			<h2>Overview of Everest Base Camp Trek- 14 Days</h2>
			<p>Mount Everest Base Camp Trek needs no introduction. Everest, also known as Chomolungma by the locals, is immortalized by trekkers and climbers. Chomolungma is its name in the Tibetan dialect, while the Nepali name of Everest is Sagarmatha. The peak is located on the Nepal and China border.

Everest Base Camp Trek 14 days is a perfect opportunity for trekkers to experience the thrills in the Khumbu valley. Highlights of the Everest trek include visits to Lukla, Namche Bazaar, Syangboche, Tengboche, Dingboche, Lobuche, Gorakshep, Khumbu Glacier, trek the Everest Base camp itself, and Kala Patthar.

Namche Bazaar is the main town in the Everest region. It is located on a two days trek length from Lukla. Khumjung and Dingboche are famous Sherpa villages of Khumbu valley. Gorakshep is the last major town before Everest Base Camp. Lobuche is the starting point for the Khumbu glacier.

The most important two destinations, Everest Base camp, and Kala Patthar lie at the very end of our journey. These two places reveal the full grandeur of the high Himalayas like no other place in the world.

The 14 days Everest Base Camp trek is tailored perfectly to extract most of the region. There are plenty of days for acclimatization, exploration, and gradual trekking. Our guides will ensure that you will be completely safe during the trek, and also make sure that you enjoy the beauty of the Everest region fully.

Everest Base Camp Trek offers many unique experiences – a chance of being close to some of the most beautiful and eight thousand-meter plus peaks in the world. The list contains names like Everest, Lhotse, Cho-Oyu, Makalu, Nuptse, Ama Dablam, Kangneta, Pumori, and Bancharo.

This Everest Base Camp trip is a rare opportunity to explore the unique flora and fauna, Dudhkoshi river, waterfalls, glaciers, monasteries, and rocky valleys. Animals like yak, jharal, blue sheep, mountain goat, snow leopard, and primates add to the thrill of the trip.

The fauna on this Everest trek is primarily subtropical in the lower belt, with rhododendron dominating the landscape. As we go further up, the vegetation turns to alpine, which is characterized by sparse pine trees. The most advanced reaches have few plants with snow completely dominating the terrain.</p>


		<p><strong>Avoid skipping the acclimatization day at Namche and Dingboche Village</strong>
		<br>The Everest Base Camp Trek (EBC Trek) places a high priority on acclimatization. A gentle rise is preferable to one that is hurried. A high-altitude trek’s success depends on hydration, rest, and proper acclimatization. What, then, qualifies as appropriate acclimatization? It involves rising to higher altitudes while taking breaks at lower altitudes.

You should spend a day in the Namche Bazaar since it is bustling with activities so that your body can acclimate to the altitude. Remember that those who foolishly overextend themselves, even those who are the fittest and healthiest, frequently succumb to (AMS) altitude mountain sickness. It’s a good idea to visit Khumjung Village or the Everest View Hotel on this day as part of your acclimatization.

The first acclimatization in Namche Bazaar occurs on the second day of the walk. Trekkers take a trip to the Everest View Hotel or Khumjung Village before returning to Namche for the evening. On this day of the acclimatization climb, trekkers are treated to stunning mountain views. Delicious mountains include Mt. Everest, Lhotse, Nuptse, Lobuche, Cholatse, Amadablam, and Thamserku. At the Dingboche Village, there is another acclimatization. Trekkers have the option of ascending Nagarjun Hill or the Chhukung Valley. Each of these places has a breathtaking landscape. These hikes also assist tourists in becoming acclimated to the altitude.</p>

<p><br><strong>Should I worry about any other things on the Everest Base Camp trek?</strong>
<br>Everest Base Camp trek is a challenging affair. You need to have some moderate experience of trekking in the mountains you can also go for a short Everest base camp and Everest view trek. We would also suggest that the trek to Everest Base Camp is mostly suitable for people above the age of sixteen.

Acclimatization could be an issue, so if you have previous experiences with altitude sickness, please consider appropriate medication or suggestions from your physician before starting the trek.

Having a small amount of money in cash can be beneficial for you should you consider buying some souvenirs.
