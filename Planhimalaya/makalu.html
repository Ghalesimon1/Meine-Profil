			<h2>Overview of Langtang Valley Trek- 11 Days</h2>
			<p>Langtang Valley Trek is a relatively short trek of medium-level difficulty in the beautiful Langtang Valley. Langtang valley lies to the north of Kathmandu and on the southern slope of the Tibetan plateau – juxtaposed between the snow-clad Himalayas in the north and the lush green hills of the Mahabharat range in the south. We start our tour from Syabrubesi and travel northwards through terraced farms that slowly give way to dense green forests and tall white mountains.

The beautiful Langtang village, which was destroyed badly by the 2015 earthquake, lies on our way. The village is slowly coming back to life. We head to the Kyanjin Gompa from here. The tour provides us a wonderful opportunity to spot rare animals and birds – including the musk deer, wild dogs, monkeys, red panda, Impeyan Pheasant, or Danfe, the national bird of Nepal, among others.

The northern reaches of the valley provide a wonderful view of mountains, including the Langtang Lirung (7,246 m) peak. Glaciers, waterfalls, and rivers fed by the melting snow and mountain vegetation paint a stunning picture that is in sharp contrast to the equally beautiful verdant terrain further down south of the valley. We stay most often with the very hospitable Tamang people.

The once-upon-a-lifetime journey, Langtang Valley Trek, is a prominent adventurous destination for all nature lovers. The Trek covers all your adventurous fantasies with a fantastic experience. The never stopping silverish glacier river, deep subtropical Forest, a never-ending chain of hills and snow-capped mountains, and unique Tibetan culture will show your childish nature.

Walking up due to the mesmerizing humming sound of Lopophorous, witnessing the beautiful view of the childish sun kissing the edge of the mountain will take you to heaven.

The frequently changing, challenging atmosphere will take a tough test to check your love for the beautiful creation of nature. This adventure will provide joy and motivate you never to give up. In short, this journey will be an excellent motivation for your life.

The Trek offers a distinctive expedition to the Himalayas. The trip comprises Langtang National Park, Kyanin Gompa Village (3870m), A Engrossing Tamang culture, Sacred Gosainkunda Lakes (4380m), and many other unexplored areas along with lots of adventures. The exciting part of the journey is that we will get a chance to become familiar with Tibetan culture.

Langtang Valley Trek provides the perfect opportunity to experience the memory of your lifetime. The Trek introduces nature’s beautiful architecture with local people’s fantastic hospitality. The Trek journey begins from Sybrubeshi, which is 110 Km/ 68.3 Miles from the capital city of Nepal.</p>
